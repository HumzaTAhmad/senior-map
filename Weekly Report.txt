WEEK 3 (FEB 27 - MAR 5)
A. Weekly Accomplishments
Describe what task was completed and by whom. Complete sentences, paragraphs, and explanations are required. In parenthesis, provide the number of hours the team member worked on the specific task.
1) Implement 3 step form to allow the creation of room, first one for location, second for the details, and third for the pictures. This was implemented by Chriss and allows the user
   to go through a three step process that allows them to add there room to rooms listing. The first step allows the user to select the location of there room. The next step allows the
   user to enter the room details such as the price, title, and description of the room. The last step allows the user to add images of there room. Which then allows them to submit it. (5 hours)
2) Implement mapbox in room creation process to show global map to user. This was implemented by Chriss and was done by creating a mapbox token and inserting it into our program environment.
   This token was then passed into the mapbox component and used to display the geographical map to the user which allows them to move there marker to the location there room is located. (3 hours)
3) Create REST endpoint for the retrieval and creation of rooms. This was done by Humza and was done so after the user submits there room form, their room information will be saved in
   the mondoDB database. This was done by using mongoose to save the created user room. The getRoom controller was added so a list of rooms can be displayed for the user when that feature
   is eventually added, this was done by using the find function in mongoose that will connect our server to the database.(5 hours)
4) Implement post route for the creation of rooms, include authentication middleware in this call. This was done by Humza and was done so only calls to the server with the corresponding
   route address can hit our room endpoints. Added the authentication middleware for this route so users who have been logged in for too long, or are not allowed this functionality will
   be signed out.(30 min)
5) Update redux state to include details object in global redux store, this will allow us to have a place to store the users room info until they submit it. This was implemented by
   Humza and was done so the information that is entered by the user about the rooms in the creation of room steps will be saved. This will ensure when they move on to different steps
   their previous information is saved and not wiped out.(2 hours)
6) Create roomModel schema in mongoDB database and model folder to specify the structure of room database entries. This was done by Humza and was done so we have a seperate collection for only room
   entries. this schema will have a structure that will only contain information about the room such as longitude, latitude, price, title, description, images, user id, user name,
   and user photo.(1 hour)

B. Problems/Issues
Describe the problem/issue, who is working on it, what the cause is, what has been tried to solve it, expected resolution. Complete sentences, paragraphs, and explanations are required.  Explain how it may affect the project schedule.
1) We are runnning into a problem with the filter feature. The logic behind filtering by price and address is getting complex since we will have to manipulate many states in our
   redux store for this filtering feature to work as intended. We have a rough solution in mind, but we are planning on skipping this and coming back to it at the end once we have
   our KNN reccomendation engine completed. Alot of time this week was wasted on trying to implement this, so skipping this is the best option for now.

C. Next week’s planned work
What do you plan to work on next week? Complete sentences, paragraphs, and explanations are required. If you have pending issues from section B, how will they affect next week’s plan?
1) Implement Geolocator controller button to find the user specific location when creating room

WEEK 2 (FEB 20 - FEB 26)
Describe what task was completed and by whom. Complete sentences, paragraphs, and explanations are required. In parenthesis, provide the number of hours the team member worked on the specific task.
A. Weekly Accomplishments
1) Implemented  User Authentication of users of Travel Nest that are not using Google login. This was implemented by Humza and was done by creating a hashed password for the user
   using and storing it in the database, when the user enters the form to login it will encrpyt the inputted password and compare it with the one in the database and the user will
   be verified. JWT token for user is also created when they login or register. *Expiration time still being worked on (3 hours)
2) Implement firebox which will be used as an image storing location that will generate an image user URL which we will store in our database. This was done by Chriss and was
   done by creating an account on firebox and copying the config file given to allow connection. We then created a function uploadFileProgress that would take the the file
   and its name and store it into our storage in firebase. This function would return a link that would give us the ability to store it into the database without storing the physical
   file. (3 hours)
3) Create get user, and create user, and update user endpoints which will be used by front end to allow users to login, register, and update there account. This was done by Humza
   and was by creating a user controller file with these three functions. Each of the functions interact with the mongoDB database in the user collection.(6 hours)
4) Create login, register action creators that will launch once login/registration forms are complete, and send a request to our API. This was done by Chriss and was implemented by
   creating three functions that all send http request to the backend given the URL that matches the route in the backend. Login will call the getUser endpoint, Register will call The
   creatUser end point.(5 hours)
5) Create update profile action creator that will lauch once update button is clicked and send the updated user information to our API. This was done by Humza and was done by adding
   another functin to the user action creator file. This function will the new information of the user and send a http request to the backend using the proper route URL and hit the
   updateProfile endpoint.(3 hours)
6) Implemented update profile route, and function in backend that will change the users information in the database based on the data received. This was done by Chriss to allow
   the requested data to update user in the database to hit the correct endpoint function, in this case updateProfile(30 min)
7) Refactored authentication middleware in backend to also authenticate the JWT token of active users to ensure it is not expired. This middleware function was done by Chriss/Humza
   will run on every request to our API and will check the current user token and verify if it is an active token. If the token's length is greater than 1000, it assumes that
   it is a Google ID token and verifies it using the verifyIdToken(). If the token's length is less than or equal to 1000, it assumes that it is a JSON Web Token (JWT) and verifies
   it using the jwt.verify() method of the jsonwebtoken package.If the token is successfully verified, the function extracts the user information from the token and adds it to the
   req object as a new user property. This user object contains the user's ID, name, and photo URL. The function then calls the next callback to pass control to the next middleware
   or route handler(3 hours each, so 6 hours)

B. Problems/Issues

WEEK 1 (FEB 13- FEB 19)
A. Weekly Accomplishments
Describe what task was completed and by whom. Complete sentences, paragraphs, and explanations are required. In parenthesis, provide the number of hours the team member worked on the specific task.

1) NavBar Creation with Login, register, and profile options. Chriss has completed the design of the website's navbar. When a user is not logged in, they are denied access to their
   user account, and the navbar only displays options to either log in or register. However, once a user logs in, they are granted access to their notifications, messages, and profile
   settings via the navbar. (4h)

2) Initialized backend Node.js server and connection with mongoDB database. This was done by Humza and was done in order to have a running server where we can make our routes and API calls that will interact with the database.
   The backend was connected to our mongoDB database by using mongoose and providing our mongoDB collection string.(2 hours)

3) Implemented Routes using express.js for /register, and /login. This was done by Humza and was done in order for incoming requests to our server to be routed to the correct API
   fucntion when they are implementd. These routes were also created using Express.js, the three routes that were made as of now are post for register, and login.(30 minutes)

4) Create mongoDB schema and collection for user was done by Humza and was done so user data that is stored in the database is stored with the proper structure, this schema was
   declared by mongoose and is named the userModel.(1 hour)

5) Implemented Login and Register form when login button is clicked in NavBar. Chriss has completed the development of a login and registration form that enables each users to access
   their account. (2h)

6) Implement Redux store in root react component, with four states including user, openLogin, loading, and alert, This was done by Chriss to ensure we have a central store where
   we can mangage the states that we need for all of our components. This was done so we can avoid the problem of prop drilling and avoid unecessary lines of code(1 hour)

7) Implement Redux reducer for state to allow the manipulation of state elements. This was done by Chriss to allow changes to the store to be made without having the need to manually
   call the store in each component and then switching the states mode.(2 hours)

8) Login registration/login using google one tap login. Chriss has finished implementing a login and registration feature that allows users either log into with different emails
   or to log in with just one tap using their Google account. Additionally, a user's profile was set up and allow user to modify their username, upload pictures with Firebase as
   storage, and provide a description. (4 hours)

9) Initialize authentication middleware in backend to verify authenticity of google login. This was done by Humza and was done so that users are given a google authentication
   token are constantly having it checked when they are making requests while logged in. Once they make a request it will check with our authentication middleware and verify that
   the corresponding token is the correct google one.(4 hours)
