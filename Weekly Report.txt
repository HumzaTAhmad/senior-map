A. Weekly Accomplishments
Describe what task was completed and by whom. Complete sentences, paragraphs, and explanations are required. In parenthesis, provide the number of hours the team member worked on the specific task.

1) NavBar Creation with Login, register, and profile options was completed by Chriss()

2) Initialized backend Node.js server and connection with mongoDB database. This was done by Humza and was done in order to have a running server where we can make our routes and API calls that will interact with the database.
   The backend was connected to our mongoDB database by using mongoose and providing our mongoDB collection string.(2 hours)

3) Implemented Routes using express.js for /register, and /login. This was done by Humza and was done in order for incoming requests to our server to be routed to the correct API
   fucntion when they are implementd. These routes were also created using Express.js, the three routes that were made as of now are post for register, and login.(30 minutes)

4) Create mongoDB schema and collection for user was done by Humza and was done so user data that is stored in the database is stored with the proper structure, this schema was
   declared by mongoose and is named the userModel.(1 hour)

5) Implemented Login and Register form when login button is clicked in NavBar was done by Chriss()

6) Implement Redux store in root react component, with four states including user, openLogin, loading, and alert, This was done by Chriss to ensure we have a central store where
   we can mangage the states that we need for all of our components. This was done so we can avoid the problem of prop drilling and avoid unecessary lines of code(1 hour)

7) Implement Redux reducer for state to allow the manipulation of state elements. This was done by Chriss to allow changes to the store to be made without having the need to manually
   call the store in each component and then switching the states mode.(2 hours)

8) Login registration/login using google one tap login. This was done by Chriss

9) Initialize authentication middleware in backend to verify authenticity of google login. This was done by Humza and was done so that users are given a google authentication
   token are constantly having it checked when they are making requests while logged in. Once they make a request it will check with our authentication middleware and verify that
   the corresponding token is the correct google one.(3 hours)
